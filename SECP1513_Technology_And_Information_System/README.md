| **Industrial Visit 1 – UTM Digital Open Day** | The UTM Digital Open Day was a valuable experience. It deepened my understanding of digital innovation and showed me how technology can enhance university life in meaningful ways. This event made me reflect on the important role technology plays in shaping learning and campus experiences, inspiring me to be more open to embracing digital change in education.                                                                                                                   | Seeing the drones at the UTM Digital Center really hit home for me. I need to stop being a passive observer and start getting my hands on these tools to master our campus systems. My focus now is on bridging the gap between theory and actual ICT infrastructure. It's about moving from a user to a creator. I need to stop being a passive observer and start exploring the full potential of our campus systems to solve real-world problems. For me, it’s about sharpening my problem-solving skills and turning lifelong learning into a daily habit so I can keep up with the fast-moving tech world. |
| **Industrial Visit 2 – Johor Port Berhad**    | The visit to Johor Port Berhad greatly enhanced my understanding of how ICT is applied in a real industrial environment. I gained valuable insight into how the four ICT main pillars work together to support both daily port operations and long-term organisational development. Learning about infrastructure management, strategic business applications, and low-code development helped me understand how ICT can improve efficiency and reduce workload in large-scale operations. | Watching the massive flow of cargo ships at the port gave me a whole new respect for system integration. It’s one thing to read about ICT infrastructure, but seeing it manage that level of complexity is another story. I’m now much more focused on learning how to tackle real-world operational bottlenecks. I want to develop the kind of problem-solving skills that actually keep these high-pressure industrial systems running smoothly.                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Industry Talk 1 – PPG**                     | Through this talk, I learned how ICT supports real business operations in a global company like PPG. It motivated me to strengthen my skills to face the dynamic digital landscape.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | I need to align my current skills with actual industrial needs. I want to move beyond the basics and master the kind of system integration that drives efficiency in the coatings industry. My goal is to stay adaptable and ready for the rapid tech shifts they described.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Industry Talk 2 – Serunai**                 | This comprehensive approach equips me not only with technical skills but also with essential organizational capabilities needed to successfully deliver complex projects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | I’ve realized that delivering a complex project takes real organizational muscle. I’m now focusing on the “big picture”—learning how to manage workflows and coordinate moving parts, not just writing code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **PC Assemble**                               | The hands-on experience of assembling a personal computer helped me better understand hardware and build practical skills, reinforcing the value of learning by doing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Building a PC from scratch was a total game-changer. It’s one thing to read about hardware, but it's another to handle it and fix cable chaos yourself. This experience really hammered home the value of learning by doing and gave me the practical confidence that a textbook never could.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
